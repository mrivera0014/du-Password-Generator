# du-week-2-password-generator

In this project I modified a starter code that allowed employees to generate random passcodes based on criteria that they selected. 

This project definitely tested my knowledge and skills on Javascript. My biggest challenge for this project was simply getting started. I found that I was struggling to think the way that JS would when reading the code. What helped was re-watching the class videos and commenting what JS would do as it read each line of code. Pseudo coding is still a little difficult but I plan on practicing it more to improve my thought process.

When I finally started to understand how JS process each line of code I began with the simple stuff such as what variables are we going to need? How are we going to tell JS when to prompt a window? How is JS going to store the user inputs? and from there the code just started to come into place.

Of course, writing the code didn't go smoothly. I did small mistakes such as forgetting a semi-colon or comma, copying a line of code to move it and leaving a bracket behind, and even just forgetting to capitalize a letter in a function. All of it was a learning experience though and I learned how to use the console to help me find where the mistakes were made.

I know that I need to keep practicing and will continue to do so. I cannot wait until all of this becomes something that I can do with more confidence.
